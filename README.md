# Animated-landing-page


HTML Structure:

The HTML sets up the basic structure of the webpage, including the navigation bar, video background, different sections with content, and the footer.
Images, text, and headings are used to showcase the facilities offered (Toptracer Range, Golf Lessons, Adventure Golf, Coffee Shop, Leagues).



Cursor Effects:

The JavaScript code creates a custom cursor ("crsr") and a blurred cursor effect ("blur") that follows your mouse movements.
When you hover over the navigation bar elements (e.g., "Toptracer Range"), the cursor changes size and color for a more interactive feel.



Scrolling Animations:

The GSAP library is used to create smooth animations as you scroll down the page.
The navigation bar gradually changes color and expands as you scroll.
Different sections of the webpage fade in and scale up with a slight delay as you scroll down, creating a dynamic viewing experience.
Overall, this code creates a visually appealing and interactive website for Sidcup Family Golf. It effectively showcases their facilities and services using animations and cursor effects to grab the user's attention.
